# Eldarion

Since 2009 the team at [Eldarion](http://eldarion.com/) has been helping
people to get from idea to launch, faster. They develop tools, apps, and
websites for clients around the world, ranging from established companies to
individuals with an entrepreneurial vision.

Open source is at the heart of Eldarion. Their team members lead or contribute
to a range of projects including Python, Django, Pinax, and many individual
Django apps.

They don't just use the best tools to get from idea to launch, they help write
them!
