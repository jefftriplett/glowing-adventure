# Django Fellow Sprint

Are you interested in contributing to Django but either can't stay for the
sprints on Thursday and Friday or just want to get a jump start on things?

An informal hallway sprint will be held in the MBA Cafe during the talks on
Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. The Django Fellow, Tim Graham, will be hanging
out there to assist anyone interested in contributing to Django's code or
documentation. All experience levels are welcome. This sprint is sponsored by
[Lincoln Loop](https://lincolnloop.com) and the [Django Software
Foundation](https://www.djangoproject.com).
