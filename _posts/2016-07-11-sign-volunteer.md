# Sign up to volunteer!

DjangoCon is organized and run by volunteers from the Django community. This
year we're looking for over 80 on-site volunteer hours to help make sure
everything runs smoothly.

Everyone who is attending DjangoCon is welcome to volunteer, but you must be
registered to volunteer at the registration desk or as a session chair or
session runner. All help is very much appreciated! We truly couldn't do this
without you. For more information, see our
[Volunteers](https://2016.djangocon.us/volunteers) page or just [sign
up](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10r_f2e-g1jdujo6gpLZbXhxqpFujo0Sj-
iw7uilDR8s/edit?usp=drive_web)!

Pro Tip: Sign up to be a Session Chair or Session Runner - it's a great
opportunity to meet the speakers!

## Session staff

Sign up to be a Session Chair or Session Runner
[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10r_f2e-
g1jdujo6gpLZbXhxqpFujo0Sj-iw7uilDR8s/edit?usp=drive_web)!

Please [read and understand the
duties](https://2016.djangocon.us/volunteers/handbook) before you sign up to
be a session chair/runner. Only sign up for one role per session. Session
Chairs and Session Runners are present for an entire session (usually 2-3
talks in a row).

## Registration Desk

[Sign up](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10r_f2e-
g1jdujo6gpLZbXhxqpFujo0Sj-iw7uilDR8s/edit?usp=drive_web) for an hour slot at
the registration desk!

This is the perfect way to meet people! You welcome them, give them their name
badge, and direct them to the coffee station and keynote room. Registration
desk shifts are only one hour, and you're welcome to work more than one shift.
If this is your first DjangoCon, it's a good way to get into volunteering!

## Swag Bag Stuffing

Just show up! Swag bag stuffing will happen on Sunday, July 17 at 1:30 pm.
Come stuff 10 bags! Many hands make light work!

## Sprints

[Sign up](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10r_f2e-
g1jdujo6gpLZbXhxqpFujo0Sj-iw7uilDR8s/edit?usp=drive_web) to help mentor or run
errands at the sprints! For this volunteer opportunity, you don't need a paid
conference pass. You just need to be willing to help newcomers to the sprints
make their first commits!
