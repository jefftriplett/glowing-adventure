# Things your mother didn't teach you about sharing your toys

Your mother probably taught you to share your toys with the other children,
and that same philosophy is at the core of the FOSS movement. However, what
your mother didn't tell you is that out in the real world, it's not just about
sharing. If you share code without a good understanding of the legal and
social systems surrounding software development, you can find yourself in hot
water.

In this talk, Russell Keith-Magee will bring the experience born of 25+ years
as a software developer, 10 years as a Django core developer, 5 years as DSF
President, and 5 years as a business owner to expose you to some topics that
every software developer _should_ know, but often aren't covered as part of
formal training. This includes legal topics such as copyrights, licensing, and
trademarks, the role played by codes of conduct, and some of the non-code
skills that are important for successful projects, and essential for
successful entrepreneurship.
