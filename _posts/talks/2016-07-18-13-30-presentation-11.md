# Under the Hood of Modern CSS Frameworks

CSS frameworks like Bootstrap have given us tools to quickly stand up sensible
looking websites. Despite the simplicity on the surface, under the hood these
frameworks are chock full of need-to-know best practices and techniques.
Understanding their inner workings can not only help you achieve better
results with your framework of choice but give you the concepts necessary to
roll your own.

Together we'll look at the code behind Bootstrap, Foundation, Semantic UI, and
other CSS frameworks. We'll identify common patterns and architectural
decisions that make these systems so easy to use. Some of the things we'll
discover:

  * What it takes to set up a good type system.
  * How style and structure are separated to make theming easier.
  * Best practices for stubbing out grid systems.
  * How configuration works.
  * How to make everything feel cohesive.
  * What it takes to test a framework so you can potentially test your own.
  * So much more!

If you're looking to improve your skills with one of these frameworks or
potentially roll your own mini-Bootstrap, this talk is for you.
