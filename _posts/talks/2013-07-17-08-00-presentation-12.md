# Confident Asset Deployments with Webpack & Django

This talk briefly introduces Webpack, a popular tool for bundling front-end
assets including JavaScript, CSS, fonts and more. We'll discover how it can
let us write advanced forms of JavaScript and CSS yet still produce files that
make even IE happy. Finally we'll see how we can integrate it with Django and
build a very nice deployment workflow for the front- and back-end engineers on
our team.

### Abstract

Webpack

  * What is it?
  * What does it do?
  * Source transformations
  * Output

Why Djangos collectstatic is not up to the job?

  * Must run after deployment
  * Doesn't do all the things
  * Slow

Integration on both sides

  * Webpack bundle tracker to output build stats
  * Django Webpack bundle loader to read those files
  * How to render links in templates.
