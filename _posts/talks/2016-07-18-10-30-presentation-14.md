# Readability Counts

Have you struggled to improve unreadable PEP8-compliant code? Come to this
talk to learn how to refactor unreadable code into something more manageable.

Most code is read many more times than it is written. Constructing readable
code is important, but that doesn't mean it's easy.

If you've ever found unreadable PEP8-compliant code and wondered how to fix
it, this talk is for you.

Long-lived code must be maintainable and readability is a prerequisite of
maintainability. It's easier to identify unreadable code than it is to create
readable code.

Let's talk about how to shape tricky code into something more readable and
more maintainable.

During this talk we'll discuss:

  * whitespace
  * self-documenting code
  * modularity
  * expectation management

We'll conclude this talk with a checklist of questions you can use to make
your own code more readable.
