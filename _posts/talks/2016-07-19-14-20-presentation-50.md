# High-Availability Django

TheAtlantic.com, with over 30 million monthly unique visitors, is one of the
most heavily trafficked media sites built entirely on Django. In this talk I
will discuss the lessons we have learned in deploying Django at scale.

One year ago we completed a years-long project of migrating theatlantic.com
from a sprawling PHP codebase to a Python application built on Django. Our
first attempt at a load-balanced Python stack had serious flaws, as we quickly
learned. Since then we have completely remade our stack from the bottom up; we
have built tools that improve our ability to monitor for performance and
service degradation; and we have developed a deployment process that
incorporates automated testing and that allows us to push out updates without
incurring any downtime. I will discuss the mistakes we made, the steps we took
to identify performance problems and server resource issues, what our current
stack looks like, and how we achieved the holy grail of zero-downtime deploys.
