# Angular 2 and You

AngularJS is one of the most popular JavaScript frameworks out there today.
But a the dawn of Angular 2 is coming! In this talk, I'll cover the broad
strokes of Angular 2, including some of the big game changers: web components
and "choose your own language" support, and how it integrates into frameworks
like Django to provide structure and maintainability to your front-end.

AngularJS is one of, if not the, most popular JavaScript framework out there
today. But a new day is coming: The dawn of Angular 2! Angular comes with a
robust community and standard of practice, but Angular 2 is something even
more intriguing: a JavaScript framework based on components (not unlike
React!), with an eye towards complying with future web standards.

In this talk, we'll cover the broad strokes of Angular 2, including some of
the big game changers: web components and "choose your own language" support,
and how it integrates into back-ends like Django to provide some structure to
your front-end. You'll learn about Angular 2's approach to the "JavaScript
framework" problem, how components create modularity in your application, and
a little bit about the JavaScript build toolchain (mysterious to many!) that
the JavaScript world is constantly debating over.
