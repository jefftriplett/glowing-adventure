# Entomology 101: Effective Bug Hunting

In this group of people, there is one thing we most certainly have in common:
We're all bug hunters. Whether you've spent your last sabbatical in Borneo
studying the embeddable iPython or you've only just begun your career and
wonder at anyone using more than django-debug-toolbar, we can all learn from
the latest trends and research in bug hunting.

From Frank's his early childhood of having a simple ant farm, up to and
including his long experience in the deepest, most pristine, and undisturbed
wilds of the Internet, his experience has honed his abilities to find and
identify bugs. Learn some of the best tools of the trade that will help in
your daily hunts.

Bug hunting tech you will learn about:

  * django-debug-toolbar
  * pdb/ipdb
  * using iPython embed
  * effectively using Python logging so you don't need to use the last quite so often

Bug hunting is all about visibility. You may have the best net ever invented,
but you can't catch a bug you can't see. Sure, you can spend all day turning
over rocks and hope for the best or you can gear up with the tried and true
night vision goggles all the pros use.
