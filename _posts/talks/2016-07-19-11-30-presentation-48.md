# Just Enough Typography

Great typography isn't just for designers. Words are everywhere and make up so
much of what the web is all about. It gives us to the power to determine the
overall readability and feelings created by our site or product. While design
resources can often be limited, good typography is too important to
compromise.

Design is 95% typography â€¦ or something like that. Having a grasp on what
makes for pleasant, easy to read typography that reinforces your brand is the
first step towards building an amazing, impactful experience. Together we will
explore typography fundamentals:

  1. Sizing, spacing, and rhythm to make all of our type feel cohesive.
  2. How to improve readability and encourage the user to read.
  3. Type families and different styles.
  4. Choosing and pairing fonts, how many to use, and when to use them.
  5. Much more!

These typography basics will help you better understand why some typefaces
just don't work and give you some go-to solutions for when the designer is out
sick (or has gone crazy). We'll learn a bunch but not too much, it will be
just enough :grin:
