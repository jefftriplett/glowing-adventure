# SSL all the things

Over the last few years SSL/TLS encryption of websites has risen tremendously.
The Let's Encrypt organization makes that pretty easy. And you can use it,
too. For free! In this talk I'll show how to integrate SSL/TLS and point out
some common pitfalls.

Over the last few years SSL/TLS encryption of not only websites but many other
services as well has risen tremendously. The [Let's
Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) organization and certificate authority (CA)
makes that pretty easy. Since September 2015 almost 1.8 million certificates
have been issued. And you can use it, too. For free!

In this talk I'll demonstrate how to integrate SSL/TLS and point out some
common pitfalls. I'll briefly layout the Let's Encrypt ACME protocol and
explain what you need to set up in Django to make SSL/TLS the default and only
way to access your site.
