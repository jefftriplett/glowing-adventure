# The Full Stack of User Experience

User experience(UX) has been at the forefront of the design world for the last
few years, but what is it and what can you do to make your applications and
websites more user friendly? At this session, you can expect to gain an
understanding of the UX core disciplines and learn how to incorporate UX
thought and strategy into your creative process.

### Abstract

User experience(UX) has come to the forefront of the design world over the
last 5-10 years. As the internet and its content have evolved, we're asking
now more than ever about user goals when they visit the websites and software
we create.

UX terms like Information Architecture, Interaction Design, and Research are
regularly thrown around, but what are they and how does it impact a site and
product?

This talk will define UX and it's sub-disciplines to bring understanding to
what UX is. Practical deliverables will be shared in an effort to give
attendees something that they can begin to implement into their process.
