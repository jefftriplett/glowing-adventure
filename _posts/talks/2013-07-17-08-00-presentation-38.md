# A new look into APIs - Graphene

It's time to ask if we can create better API's with new paradigms. Graphene is
a new framework for Python based on GraphQL that allows us to create and
develop simpler and more scalable API's with Django.

### Abstract

REST API's have been with us a long time. It's time to ask if we can create
better API's with new paradigms. We will discuss new ways to query and
manipulate data so that our code becomes simpler and easier to scale.

GraphQL is a query language created by Facebook in 2012 which provides a
common interface between the client and the server for data fetching and
manipulations. We will do a quick overview of GraphQL and focus later on
Graphene, the main GraphQL framework for Python.

[Graphene](http://graphene-python.org/) allows us to reuse our existing Django
Models to create schemas quickly and easily. We would like to think of it as
the next natural step from the Django Rest Framework.
