# From Developer to Manager

As developers move along in their career, they will often be given the chance
to move into management. This can be great, but it can also end in tears. In
this talk we'll follow one developer's journey into management. Through that
process we'll explore what one should think about before embarking on their
own journey as well as some lessons for those who do decide to go down the
management path.

As developers move along in their career, they are often encouraged to take on
roles that involve more and more people management and less code.

Stepping towards management often can be a good move to make, but it is not
one that should be taken lightly. If such a move is taken without a full
appreciation for what it truly is (a career change), it can lead to woe and
misery for all involved.

In this talk we'll follow one developer's journey from coding 40 hours/week to
primarily managing humans. What worked well, what didn't work well, what was
hard, and what was surprising.

Attendees of this talk should expect to walk away with a better idea of if
they may be suited for management and if so, how they can successfully
acclimate to their new role.
