# Making a splash with your open source project

So you've written a bunch of code, and you think others might find it useful.
You open source it, and... profit, right? Well, no. PyPI is filled with
thousands of projects that have been released with the best of intentions, but
never really break into the mainstream. How do you escape this trap, and
maximize the chance that your project will actually be used, grow and thrive?

### Abstract

Russell Keith-Magee has contributed to and started a large number of open
source projects. Django is the one he's most known for, but there have been
many others - Evolution, Cricket, Bugjar, Toga... the list goes on. In this
talk, Russell will share the experience he has gained - both good and bad - at
trying to generate interest in new open source projects.
