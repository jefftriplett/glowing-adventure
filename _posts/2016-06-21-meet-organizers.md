# Meet the Organizers!

Who is running this thing?

DjangoCon US would not be possible without the hundreds of hours of volunteers
have put in over the past year. We're thrilled to have a mix of returning and
new faces on our organizing team. Together, the organizers for DjangoCon US
are making sure that the conference is welcoming, accessible, friendly to
beginners, safe, diverse, affordable, and has the greatest talk and tutorial
lineup.

The organizers listed here aren't the only volunteers, of course. We'd like to
give a huge shoutout to everyone who's contributed to our [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/djangocon/2016.djangocon.us) (which includes
code and documentation contributions, filing bug reports, and answering
questions); everyone who's suggested improvements to the website and
conference over email and on Twitter; the people who've helped us with
outreach by reaching out to meetups and organizations they're part of; the
maintainers and contributors to the Django Project and the vast ecosystem of
related open source projects that make up so much of the conference and
sprints; and the onsite volunteers who will serve as sessions chairs and
runners, swag bag stuffers, and sprints mentors. We couldn't do this without
your help.

Meet the DjangoCon US 2016 organizers, and read more about them on the
[Organizers](https://2016.djangocon.us/organizers/) page!
