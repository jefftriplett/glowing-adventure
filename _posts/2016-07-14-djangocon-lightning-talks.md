# DjangoCon Lightning Talks

Coming to DjangoCon next week? Have you thought about giving a Lightning Talk?

Lightning Talks are short talks with a 5 minute maximum. We'll have 3 time
slots (July 18-20, Noon to 12:45pm) available. You'll be able to sign up to
propose a Lightning Talk at the conference, not in advance.

Lightning Talks are an EXCELLENT way to get started giving presentations, if
you haven't given one before or have been nervous about doing it.

We look forward to seeing your amazing Lightning Talks at DjangoCon!
