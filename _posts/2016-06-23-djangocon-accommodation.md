# Last Call for Accommodation

Are you waiting until the last minute to book your rooms? Great news: We still
have hotel rooms available :) This is our last call for hotel room
reservations.

We'd like to give everyone one last reminder that you should book your
accommodations with the [Sheraton](https://www.starwoodmeeting.com/events/star
t.action?id=1603118961&key=23444EEB) by the **end of the day on June 27**, or
at the [Homewood](http://group.homewood-suites.com/DJANGO) by the **end of the
day on July 1**, if you'd like to take advantage of our special hotel room
rate.

Not only does this ensure that you save (a lot) of money, but it also helps
us! We are _only 3 room reservations short_ of fulfilling our obligation at
the Sheraton, and rather more at the Homewood. By booking room nights you help
us avoid having to pay a penalty for not hitting our room minimum. We're sure
we can all agree that we'd rather save the money for our financial aid program
next year instead of paying it to the venue, right?

Why should you book your room with our venue?

It's convenient! Booking your room at one of the hotels we chose is convenient
and you are only a short walk away from the conference. Our rate is a great
deal! Some of us who are flying in early to Philly have been quoted rates of
$329 a night for other hotels. Our rate of $199 a night is a tremendous
savings.

To lower our conference prices! We have to cover a minimum number of room
nights or else we have to pay a penalty. Why do we have a room minimum? We had
to guarantee a minimum set of rooms to get the special rate. While we are
doing well financially, we'd rather spend that money on the conference,
increase our donation to the DSF, and save some money to help fund DjangoCon
US 2017.

We also understand that not everyone is fortunate enough to work for a company
who is willing to pay for these costs. We aren't asking you to cancel your
AirBNB reservations or put yourself in a bad financial situation. But,if you
haven't booked your room, now is the time!

We are glad that you are attending DjangoCon US and we appreciate your
consideration.

See you in Philly this summer!
