# Day 1 Orientation

How can you have the BEST DjangoCon ever, even if it's your first conference?
Come to the Day 1 Orientation!

We've gotten a lot of feedback from DjangoCon US 2015. One recurring theme was
this: people attending their first con or attending DjangoCon alone often felt
a little lost, overwhelmed, or left out. An informal survey of potential new
conference attendees also revealed the desire for some sort of "guidance" when
attending a conference. So, to address this, we've created a Day 1 Orientation
session. The goal is to help people put their best foot forward at their first
DjangoCon US or first tech conference.

The orientation page can be found
[here](https://2016.djangocon.us/orientation/) and more details will be added
as we get closer to DjangoCon. We look forward to seeing you in Philly and to
you having the BEST DjangoCon US you can have!
