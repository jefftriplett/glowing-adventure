# How We Allocated Financial Aid

Deciding how to allocate our financial aid budget is something we take very
seriously.

This year we are able to provide free conference tickets to all speakers, and
pushed back early bird pricing to enable more attendees to buy tickets at the
lower price. In addition, we worked to provide funds for travel, lodging, and
other needs to applicants who stated a need for financial assistance.

The DjangoCon US financial aid committee uses
[Grorg](https://github.com/andrewgodwin/grorg), a Django app created by Andrew
Godwin to anonymously score applications. Once all applications have been
scored, the committee makes the final decision on how our funds should be
allocated.

We scored each application in random order from 1 to 5 based on the following
criteria:

  * What is the realistic benefit to the applicant?
  * Does the applicant have clear, specific, concrete, realistic ideas about what they will gain from attending the conference?
  * Do I feel the applicant really, really wants to attend DjangoCon US? 
  * What is the overall value for money? The goal is to help as many people as possible attend DjangoCon who otherwise wouldn't be able to. 
  * What is my overall feeling about the application?

Overall, we look for concrete ideas and commitments in applications. We try to
choose those who need it and those whose lives and careers will most be
affected by attending DjangoCon US. We tried to ensure that speakers are able
to attend while also giving opportunities to non-speakers and attendees new to
the Django community. As you can imagine, the choice is not easy.

Our selection criteria and process is borrowed from the [DjangoGirls
Organizer's Manual](http://organize.djangogirls.org/attendees/README.html) and
suggested by Daniele Procida.
