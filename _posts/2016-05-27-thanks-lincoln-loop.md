# Thanks Lincoln Loop!

Thanks again to [Lincoln Loop](https://lincolnloop.com/) for sponsoring this
year as a Diamond level sponsor! We also want to thank them for doing a
wonderful job on the DjangoCon US 2016 website this year!

We're so very lucky and happy to have [Lincoln Loop](https://lincolnloop.com)
as a Diamond sponsor. In addition to providing our website for DjangoCon US
2016 at the hands of [Mark Wirblich](https://lincolnloop.com/team/mark-
wirblich/), founder [Peter Baumgartner](https://lincolnloop.com/team/peter-
baumgartner/) has been essential to the fundraising efforts that help make
DjangoCon US possible.

If you are looking to level up your Django skills you should check out [High
Performance Django](https://highperformancedjango.com/) written by the Lincoln
Loop team. It will give you a repeatable blueprint for building and deploying
fast, scalable Django sites.
