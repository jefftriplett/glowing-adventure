# Thanks Revsys!

Thanks again to [REVSYS](http://www.revsys.com/) for sponsoring this year!

[REVSYS](http://www.revsys.com/) gives back to the Django community in many
ways!

We're very lucky to have REVSYS' own [Jeff
Triplett](https://twitter.com/webology) as DjangoCon's Conference Chair! Jeff
is also the President of [DEFNA](http://www.defna.org/).

President &amp; Founder [Frank Wiles](https://twitter.com/fwiles) also serves
as the President of the [Django Software
Foundation](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/).
