# Code of Conduct Transparency Report: YouTube Comments

We had some Code of Conduct issues in the comments of our conference videos.

**What happened**

In 2015, we turned off YouTube comments on all our talk videos by default.
This year, we forgot to take that step. When the videos of the 2016 conference
talks started being posted to YouTube, we had an influx of wonderful,
positive, complimentary comments that made us proud of our community, so we
decided not to limit comments on videos.

This was a mistake.

On Friday, August 19, we were notified by one of our speakers that several
people had posted harassing comments on the video of their talk.

We apologize to this speaker for not moderating comments from the very
beginning. It's our responsibility as organizers to ensure the safety and
well-being of all our speakers, even after the conference is over. We failed
to do that, and we're sorry.

**What actions we took**

By Monday, August 22, we had taken the following actions:

  * Contacted the speaker to thank them for letting us know, apologize for creating circumstances that allowed this to happen, and let them know what we planned to do
  * Reported all abusive comments to YouTube 
  * Initiated internal discussion about comments that were borderline, and reported the ones that we decided violated the Code of Conduct 
  * Removed the ability to comment further on all talk videos (Later in the weekend we re-enabled the ability to comment, but all comments are now moderated and must be approved by an organizer.) 
  * Reviewed comments on all other videos (no other video had received harassing comments at that time)
  * Prepared a Code of Conduct report for the Django Software Foundation 

We can confirm that the abusive comments no longer appear on that video.

We don't know the identities of the people who commented, and we don't know if
they are members of the Django community. We took screenshots of the comments
and commenters and have reported them to the DSF.

**What we're doing to prevent this happening again**

In the future, comments on all DjangoCon US conference talk videos will be
moderated from the beginning, and speakers will be asked whether they would
like us to disable comments on their talk videos entirely. Members of the Code
of Conduct team and other conference organizers will have access and be able
to monitor and approve comments. Harassing or abusive comments, or comments
that otherwise violate the Code of Conduct, will not be approved.

People who moderate YouTube comments will be trained in what to look for when
moderating comments. For example, hate speech, abusive comments, and insults
are violations of the Code of Conduct and are not acceptable. Comments that
simply disagree with the speaker in a civil manner are acceptable.

We will also make it clear that the DjangoCon US Code of Conduct applies to
all online spaces, including YouTube comments. Again, we don't know if these
commenters attended the conference or are members of the Django community, but
we want to be sure that members of our community know that the official
DjangoCon US YouTube channel, and conference talk videos from DjangoCon US
posted by other users, are covered by the Code of Conduct.

**A final note**

At DjangoCon US, we want to create warm and welcoming spaces where people can
learn new skills, be exposed to groundbreaking technology, have important
conversations, meet developers from all over the world, and be exposed to new
and challenging ideas. For those goals to be successful, we need to ensure
that DjangoCon US is a safe place for people to express those ideas and have
those conversations. We deeply regret that our actions caused harm to this
speaker.
