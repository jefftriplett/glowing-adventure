# Sentry

[Sentry](https://getsentry.com/welcome/) provides modern crash reporting not
only for your [Django backend](https://getsentry.com/for/django/?utm_source=dj
angocon&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=sponsor-post), but also for [JavaScript](
https://getsentry.com/for/javascript/?utm_source=djangocon&utm_medium=blog&utm
_campaign=sponsor-post), [iOS](https://getsentry.com/for/swift/?utm_source=dja
ngocon&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=sponsor-post), or [Android](https://getsen
try.com/for/java/?utm_source=djangocon&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=sponsor-
post) clients.

Uniquely, the story of Sentry actually begins with Django's open source
community. Their co-founder, David Cramer, had been involved early on in the
Django community. He had written and open sourced a very basic [exception
logger](https://github.com/dcramer/django-db-log) for Django. It had been
widely adopted by the community and as the project grew, was adopted by
massive tech companies, like Uber, Pinterest, Dropbox, etc. Today, it's a team
of 13 that includes Armin Ronacher, the creator of Flask.
