# Assisted Listening Devices

For our attendees who are hard of hearing or who would benefit from them, we
have assisted listening devices you can reserve at no cost for your use during
the conference.

The Wharton School has generously provided us with a limited number of
[assisted listening device headsets](http://www.manualslib.com/manual/897874
/Phonic-Ear-Pe-600e.html?page=9#manual). The specific model is available at
that link. They are wired into the room's full audio facilities: computer
audio and microphones. The wireless headsets have independent volume control
for each ear, so they can be tuned.

To make sure we have enough headsets available, please [fill out this
form](http://goo.gl/forms/Wy5sg5Ji9jSIu4O03) to let us know which days you'd
like to reserve a headset.

**Note**: We will not be able to have live captioning at DjangoCon US this year, but we hope that the assisted listening devices will be helpful to those who need it! If you would like to attend DjangoCon but are concerned that the event won't be accessible to you, please [check out our venue page](https://2016.djangocon.us/venue/) or [send us an email](https://2016.djangocon.us/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#cfa7aaa3a3a08faba5aea1a8a0aca0a1e1babc). We will do everything we can to make you welcome at DjangoCon US.
