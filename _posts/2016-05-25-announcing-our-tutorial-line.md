# Announcing Our Tutorial Line Up

Hey everyone! After a _ton_ of deliberation and sifting through an amazing
collection of submissions, we've settled on the tutorials for DjangoCon US
2016. A huge thank you to everyone that submitted (you seriously made this so
hard) and to all of the reviewers. We tried to make sure that the tutorials
would offer a little something for everyone this year, from beginner
Djangonauts to UX design to security and optimization. So, in no particular
order, here are your DjangoCon 2016 tutorials:

### Demystifying the Django REST Framework

Sunday, July 17th, 12:30PM - 5:00PM

_Presented by:_ [Haris Ibrahim K V](https://twitter.com/harisibrahimkv)

This tutorial will build the API for an app and walk you through the ins and
outs of Django REST Framework. Routers, ViewSets, Serializers, generic views,
and more.

### An Introduction to Secure Web Developmet with Django (and Python!)

Sunday, July 17th, 9:00AM - 12:30PM

_Presented by:_ [James Bennett](https://twitter.com/ubernostrum)

You can't afford to have security be an optional or "nice-to-have" feature in
your applications. Luckily, Django has your back: this workshop will introduce
you to thinking about security, cover some common (and some less-common)
security concerns, and walk you through, in detail, how Django and the broader
Django and Python ecosystems can help protect you and your users from them.

### Designing Good User Experience

Sunday, July 17th, 9:00AM - 12:30PM

_Presented by:_ [Zan Anderle](https://twitter.com/z_anderle)

This tutorial will introduce you to basic concepts of user experience design.
Using an example project, you'll work through designing and improving UX with
simple, real-world techniques.

### Supercharge Your Next Project with the Cookiecutter Django Framework

Sunday, July 17th, 12:30PM - 5:00PM

_Presented by:_ [Audrey Roy Greenfeld](https://twitter.com/audreyr) and
[Daniel Roy Greenfeld](https://twitter.com/pydanny)

Cookiecutter Django is a framework for jumpstarting production-ready Django
projects quickly. Coming with dozens of proven third-party packages already
preconfigured, you can jump right into the code. In this tutorial, you'll
learn about using it from beginning to end, including installation, usage,
tips, and cutting-edge tricks. You'll walk away with your own documented,
tested, production-ready ice cream-themed project.

### Hello Web App Workshop

Sunday, July 17th, 9:00AM - 12:30PM

_Presented by:_ [Tracy Osborn](https://twitter.com/limedaring)

This workshop will walk you through creating a basic web app using Python and
Django. Start working on your first web product with a database, registration
and login forms, and perhaps get on the path to a fun side-project or future
startup. Tailored for designers and non-programmers and taught by a designer.

### Grow Your Twitter Bot Garden

Sunday, July 17th, 12:30PM - 5:00PM

_Presented by:_ [Terian Koscik](https://twitter.com/spine_cone)

Come plant a Twitter bot garden and watch it grow! This workshop is for Python
developers who are interested in making small, creative programming projects
and have never made a Twitter bot before. You'll walk through setting up a
simple bot that tweets lines of a book 140 characters at a time. Then, you'll
customize it using free, publicly accessible data sources and your
imagination.

So now that you've seen all of the tutorials that are available, [what are you
waiting for?](https://defna.ticketbud.com/djangocon-us-2016) Each session is
$150 and runs about 3 hours long. You can [buy
tickets](https://defna.ticketbud.com/djangocon-us-2016) for tutorials in the
same place that you buy admission to the conference itself.

We'll see you there!
