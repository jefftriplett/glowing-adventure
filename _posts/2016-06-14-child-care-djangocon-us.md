# Child Care at DjangoCon US!

We're excited to offer complimentary child care for children ages 18 months to
6 years old during the conference and sprint days!

To sign up your child, [fill out this
form](http://goo.gl/forms/SFCtJv23Vgoffgll2) as soon as possible! There is
only limited space available, so don't wait to let us know you're bringing
your kiddos.

Our provider is [Saint Mary's Church Nursery
School](http://stmarysnursery.org/), 3916 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104.

From the Saint Mary's Nursery School website:

"Saint Mary's Nursery School is a non-profit cooperative day care center,
founded in 1964. We provide day care for children from 18 months to 6 years.
Our core belief is that family and community involvement in our program
fosters a caring, trusting, healthy environment for our children. Our unique
parent help program, work days, and our diverse board of directors all
exemplify this cooperative approach. Each member takes an active role in
making St. Mary's a great place for our children to learn and grow. While we
share the wonderful and centrally located Saint Mary's Episcopal Church
building, we are not associated with the Church. We are a separate entity, and
non-denominational."

Drop-off starts at 7:30 am, and children should be picked up no later than
6:00 pm.

Their location is just a couple blocks away from Huntsman Hall, where the
conference will take place. They will be able to care for children at their
nursery during the conference, at no cost to you!

Child care is available during the talks and sprints (5 days) of the
conference, Monday, July 18 - Friday, July 22.
