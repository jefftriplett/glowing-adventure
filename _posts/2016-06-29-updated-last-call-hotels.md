# Updated Last Call for Hotels - More Rooms Available!

Good news for those who still need to book their hotel!

The [Sheraton](https://www.starwoodmeeting.com/events/start.action?id=16031189
61&key=23444EEB) has made more rooms available for July 19, which had
previously sold out. The Sheraton has also extended our booking window through
July 6! This means that there are rooms for you to book, and you have a few
extra days to make your reservation.

The [Homewood](http://group.homewood-suites.com/DJANGO) has also extended our
group booking window through July 4! We are starting to fill our block at The
Homewood, so don't wait until Monday--book now!

Both hotels offer the special rate of $199/night, and include wifi and other
perks in the room rate. Both hotels are a short walk from Huntsman Hall, so
you'll be as close as you can be without actually camping in the presentation
rooms. Please note: that's not an option! So book your hotel today!
