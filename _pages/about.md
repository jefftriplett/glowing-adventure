## DjangoCon US is for everyone interested in Django

DjangoCon US is a 6-day international community conference for the community
by the community about the Django web framework, held each year in North
America.

DjangoCon has something for everyone, from the person who develops Django
applications for a living to the person who just tinkers in their spare time.
Whether you're a Django expert, just started working in Django recently, or
are interested in learning, we have talks and tutorials for you.

You'll discover details about a range of diverse applications that people from
all over the world are building with Django, get a deeper understanding of
concepts you're already familiar with and discover new ways to use them, and
have a lot of fun!

You can meet your friends from the Django community, make new friends,
socialize with Django (core) developers, and enjoy time in The City of
Siblingly Love.

Conduct](https://2016.djangocon.us/coc/).
